### Student
As someone who enjoys listening to music, I would really enjoy hearing my
favorite  tunes in a different pitch. This tool will make an old song sound refreshing!

### Professional Vocalist
As a professional singer, this tool is great for pitching a song into my vocal range
so that I can easily sing along with songs I wouldn't usually be able to.

### Digitial Music Writer
It's useful to be able to hear the songs I'm trying to recreate and remix before I put in
a bunch of effort to make them.
